## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Usage

#### Prerequisites
### iOS

Add the following keys to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called _Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description_ in the visual editor.

### Android

* `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Permission for usage of external storage
#### Imports
```
import 'package:davinci/core/davinci_capture.dart';
import 'package:davinci/davinci.dart';
```

#### Pseudo code


| If the widget is in the widget tree  <br> Use `click` method| If the widget is not in the widget tree  <br> Use `offStage` method |

<hr>
 By default the generated image name will be "davinci". But if you wish to change it, you can pass the image name in  DavinciCapture.click method.
 
```
await DavinciCapture.click(imageKey, fileName: "Hello");
```
<hr>
When the image is captured, you can either open the image preview or get the image in Uint8List.

```
await DavinciCapture.click(imageKey, fileName: "Hello", openFilePreview = false, returnImageUint8List = true);
```
 <hr>
If the captured image is pixelated, calculate the pixel ratio dynamically based on the device and pass it to the DavinciCapture.click method.

```
double pixelRatio = MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio;

await DavinciCapture.click(imageKey, fileName: "Hello", pixelRatio: pixelRatio);
```
<hr>

To save the image directly to the device, set `saveToDevice` flag to `true`. You can also specify the album name or you can leave it undefined.

````
await DavinciCapture.click(imageKey, fileName: "Hello", saveToDevice = true, album: "Davinci");
````
<hr>

‚ÑπÔ∏è <i><b>All the parameters in the `click` method is present in `offStage` method too.</i></b>

## üõéÔ∏è Note :

 - <b>Cannot capture Platformview due to issue https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25306 </b>
 - <b>If you wish to save the generated images locally, do remeber to add necessary permissions in `info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.
